# Python Style
- Follow existing code patterns; do not invent new APIs or module layouts.
- Target Python 3.12+ and use type hints for public functions and methods.
- Prefer ruff for linting and formatting; do not fight the formatter.
- Keep functions small and focused; avoid unnecessary globals and side effects.
- Update or add tests when behavior changes.
