# MR Review Notes for Docs
- Keep docs accurate and aligned with current code behavior.
- Update examples and commands when APIs or workflows change.
- Avoid overstating capabilities; state assumptions explicitly.
- For any change set, use the review rubric in `.github/skills/mr-review-checklist/SKILL.md`.
