# Installation in VS Code

1. Copy `.github/`, `docs/`, and `AGENTS.md` into your repo.
2. Enable Copilot instruction files in VS Code settings.
3. Confirm the prompt and agent pickers can see `.github/prompts/` and `.github/agents/`.

Tool names are environment-dependent; match the VS Code tool picker when prompts or agents reference tools.
