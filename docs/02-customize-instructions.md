# Customize Instructions

- Prefer adding new `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` files with narrow `applies_to` globs.
- Avoid editing repo-wide instructions unless you want changes to affect everything.
- Keep instructions short and action-oriented; do not restate obvious facts.
- Always include "follow existing repo patterns" and "do not invent APIs" guidance.
