# Building Skills

Skills are playbooks with optional scripts, references, and assets. Each skill must include `SKILL.md` with
YAML frontmatter containing `name` and `description` only.

Guidance:
- Keep `SKILL.md` concise and action-oriented.
- Put templates in `assets/` and scripts in `scripts/`.
- Avoid extra docs like README or changelogs inside skill folders.
- Use references sparingly and link them from `SKILL.md`.
- No secrets or tokens in skill content.
